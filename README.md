# odin-recursion

The goal of this project was to create two recursive functions:

- Fibonacci: returns all Fibonacci numbers up to the n-th number, where n is the number of terms to be computed,
- merge sort: a recursive implementation of the merge sort algorithm that returns a sorted array.

Both functions demonstrate the use of recursion in solving common algorithmic problems
